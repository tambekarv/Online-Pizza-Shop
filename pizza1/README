README for pizza1_setup
Hopefully all the directories and filenames you need show
up in this setup.  However the file contents need finishing.

Please make sure you can run the project on topcat, because
that's where the grader will run it.  See database.php for
code that lets you run on topcat. Be sure to load the pizza
database in your mysql account on topcat.

This project is set up to be installed at /cs637/username/pizza1
relative to the document root, where username is your topcat username.

Under Windows XAMPP, at \xampp\htdocs\cs637\username\pizza1
Under Mac OSX XAMPP, at /Applications/XAMPP/xampfiles/cs637/username/pizza1
Under Linux XAMPP, at /opt/lampp/cs637/username/pizza1

On topcat, at /var/www/html/cs637/username/pizza1
You have private access to this area using UNIX file permissions,
just as you have private access to your ~/cs637 directory area.

Note that you need to edit in your topcat username in two places
in these sources:
1. in model/database.php
2. in view/header.php
